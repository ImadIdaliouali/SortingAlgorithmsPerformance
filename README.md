# Sorting Algorithms Performance

This repository contains C code to implement multiple sorting algorithms. It also includes a timer function to measure their execution times.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

Here is a table that lists the sorting algorithms implemented in this project:

| Algorithms     |
| -------------- |
| Insertion Sort |
| Selection Sort |

## Usage

1. Compile and Generate the Plot:

```bash
$ make re
```

This will compile the program, run it, and generate the performance graph, all in one command.

2. View Performance Results:

The performance measurement results will be stored in `data.txt`.

3. View Performance Graph:

The performance graph is generated as `graph.png`. You can open this image to visualize the performance of sorting algorithms.

4. To clean up the executable, use the following command:

```bash
$ make clean
```
